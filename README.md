### Info

A website that I decided to make after some inspiration from typical memory flashcard games. Originally, this did not have a scoring system and it only had the feature to flip and unflip. After a while, I decided to replicate Wordle's Guess Distribution for this game as well. This was done using Charts.css, which provided an easy-to-implement system to put charts on your website, using classes just like Bootstrap.
